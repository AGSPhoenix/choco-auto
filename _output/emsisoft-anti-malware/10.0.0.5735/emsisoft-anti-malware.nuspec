    <description>
Emsisoft Anti-Malware is fueled by a dual engine malware scanner for twice the malware cleaning power, with no extra resource requirements.

On top of that, Emsisoft Anti-Malware can even remove potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that overload your computer with resource wasting bloat.

Altogether, that guarantees superior detection, efficient removal, and a clean Windows operating system where youâ€™re completely Malware-Free.

By default Emsisoft Anti-Malware installs as a free fully functional 30 day trial version. After the trial period you can either choose to buy a full version license or switch to the limited freeware mode. The freeware mode still allows you to scan and clean infections, but it doesn't provide any real-time protection to guard against new infections.

Emsisoft Anti-Malware doesn't allow package updates. Whoever comes up with a working uninstall script is welcome to share.
